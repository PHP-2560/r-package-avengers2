# fecScrape

The fecScrape package provides functions to interface with the [OpenFEC API](https://api.open.fec.gov/developers/). OpenFEC API allows you to access funding data on candidates and committees. This package allows users to scrape individual- and aggregated-level donation data, plot these data to examine the timecourse of donation as well as geographic spread of donations, and does some basic summary statistics. 

# Thanks

During this class project, we came across another package which inspired our own code and thoughts on how to develop this package. Please check out the [tidyusafec](https://github.com/stephenholzman/tidyusafec) package, written by Stephen Holzman. 

# Installation 

To finish when the R package is complete. 

# Functions

To Do: Create a naming schematic for the functions such that all functions which interface with the OpenFEC API use the "query_" prefix and all functions which plot data use the "plot_" prefix.
